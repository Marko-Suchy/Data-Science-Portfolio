# Luddism on Diffusion Networks
This Project is ongoing as of April 2024. It is my undergraduate physics honors thesis. Note that that project files are missing for this project, as they are too expansive to include in this GitHub repository. Devlopment of a GitHub repository soley dedicted to this project is currently underway at:

## Project Abstract:
We study innovation dynamics through social networks, including the possibility for rejection of innovation. We make a slight improvement to the LISA model mean-field, such that is results in a steady state with exclusively Adopter and Luddites. We then implement this improved model on Erdos-Renyi random graphs using Monte-Carlo techniques. We study the match between mean field and Monte-Carlo based approaches. We then use regression analysis to understand how both local and global network structural features effect the extent of innovation adoption in the final state. We find that under T-LISA dynamics, adoption is most likley to spread through small dense network clusters.

## Demonstrated Skills and Techniques
* Network based Monte-Carlo simulation in Python
* Database management
* Python NetworkX package proficiency
* Data visualization using matplotlib in Python
* Regression analysis using statsmodels in Python
* Data wrangling using Pandas in Python
* Technical writing

## Data Sources
All data for this project was generated in Monte-Carlo simulations.

## Final Product Description
The Final products of this project include a poster, a powerpoint, and a paper. The poster was presentat at the American Physical Society 2024 March Meeting. The powerpoint was publicly presented in April 2024, to the Washington and Lee community. The paper will soon be archved in the W&L library, upon it's completeion. 

## Coauthorship Credit
This project was coauthored by Irina Mazilu PhD, and me, Marko Suchy.
