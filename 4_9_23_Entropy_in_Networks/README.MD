# Entropy In Networks

This paper and presentation were created in tandem as a final project for my PHYS 345 (statistical physics.) It explores modern literature on the application of Shannon's information entropy to various network systems.

## Demonstrated Skills:
* Interpretation of probability mass functions in networks to understand entropic measures.
* Literature Review.
