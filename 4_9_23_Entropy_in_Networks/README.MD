# Entropy In Networks

This paper and presentation were created in tandem as a final project for my PHYS 345 (statistical physics.) They explore modern literature on the application of Shannon's information entropy to network systems. The attached presentation offers an approachable explanation of this project, and is a great place to start.

## Demonstrated Skills:
* Interpretation of probability mass functions in networks to understand entropic measures.
* Literature Review.
