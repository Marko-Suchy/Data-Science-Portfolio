# The Future of Ursus Maritimus
This Project was completed in May 2023, for BIOL 365 - Ecological Modeling.

## Project Description:
This project utilized a stage-based SIR model to examine how a novel virus could effect the population projection of Alaskan Polar Bears (Ursus Maritimus.) The project finds a relationship between virality and death rate which defines the effect of novel virus on population projection. 

## Demonstrated Skills and Techniques
* Stage-based SIR modeling in Vensim
* Monte-Carlo simulation methods in Vensim
* Sensitivity analysis
* Data visualization in R

## Data Sources
Data for the projection matrix of Alaskan polar bears was pulled from Comadre:

## Final Product Description
The Final product of this project is a poster, presented to the BIOL 365 class in May 2023.

## Coauthorship Credit
This project was coauthored by Alicia Nugyen, and me, Marko Suchy.
