# Marko Suchy's Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here, you'll find projects I've comepleted during my time at Washington and Lee University. Please start with reading the "My Modelling Education" essay, which describes how I've learned to collect data ethically, prepare and transform data, and interpert and communicate data.


In each project folder, you'll find two subfolders, and a README.md file. Each README file contains a breif description of the project, along with the skills and techniques which the project emphasised, a description of the final result of the project, and coauthorship credits. The 'Project_Files' subfolder contains the data, scripts, images, and other project files as they were stored during the project's creation. The 'Final_Outputs' subfolder contains the product of each project. 

I hope these projects offer a window into how I work as a data scienctist!
