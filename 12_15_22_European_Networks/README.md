# European Networks
This Project was completed in December 2022, for SOAN 265 - Exploring Social Networks.

## Project Description:
This project scraped data about economic, militaristic, and cultural relations in Europe, and turned these relational datasets into networks. Actor prominence was analyzed in all three networks. Finally, Exponential Random Graph Models were used to understand the driving facrots behind edge formation. 

## Demonstrated Skills and Techniques
* Web scraping using BeutifulSoup4 in Python
* Relational database visualization using stat-net in R
* Node prominance analysis in networks, carried out using R
* Social network analysis with exponential random graph models

## Data Sources
This project utilized data from:
